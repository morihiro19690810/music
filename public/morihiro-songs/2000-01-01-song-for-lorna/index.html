<p>Long after the party<br>
When everyone's gone home<br>
You're clearing the table all alone</p>
<p>You smile on me sweetly<br>
And said that you'd do it by yourself<br>
But I'm not so cold, I can't leave you alone</p>
<p>I see you're feeling lonely inside<br>
When nobody's standing by your side<br>
And what you're feeling now you're trying to hide</p>
<p>So let me help you and wait for you tonight<br>
As long as you want me to<br>
I'll do anything for you, I'm your best friend</p>
<p>I remember the times<br>
When I treated you like a stranger<br>
I remember the days when I let you down</p>
<p>But now I can see you<br>
Standing before my very eyes<br>
Shining so holy and so bright</p>
<p>I know I'm feeling tormented and torn apart<br>
When nobody's so kind as you are<br>
And what I'm feeling now is breaking my heart</p>
<p>So let me feel your love like Jesus Christ<br>
Until my heartache heals<br>
I'll be always by your side as your best friend</p>
<p>I see you're feeling lonely inside<br>
When nobody's standing by your side<br>
And what you're feeling now you're trying to hide</p>
<p>So let me help you and wait for you tonight<br>
As long as you want me to<br>
I'll do anything for you, I'm your best friend</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This song was dedicated to Miss Lorna Nakamoto, my English teacher who guided me to the love of Jesus Christ. In 1990 she got married with a Japanese engineer and returned to her hometown, Hawaii. Since then I have not heard of her, but I do hope that she is living a happy life with her husband.</p>
