It took some time to hold you so close to me.  
It took some time to know that we're meant to be.  
I've been through hazards.  
I'm back on the fairway.  
Now that it's time for us to open new horizons.  
  
君のもとにたどりつくまで  
君が運命の人だと気づくまで  
だいぶ時間がかかってしまった  

いくつも障害を越えて  
フェアウエイに戻ってきたよ  
今こそが僕らの Opening New Horizons
