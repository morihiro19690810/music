Long after the party  
When everyone's gone home  
You're clearing the table all alone

You smile on me sweetly  
And said that you'd do it by yourself  
But I'm not so cold, I can't leave you alone

I see you're feeling lonely inside  
When nobody's standing by your side  
And what you're feeling now you're trying to hide

So let me help you and wait for you tonight  
As long as you want me to  
I'll do anything for you, I'm your best friend

I remember the times  
When I treated you like a stranger  
I remember the days when I let you down

But now I can see you  
Standing before my very eyes  
Shining so holy and so bright

I know I'm feeling tormented and torn apart  
When nobody's so kind as you are  
And what I'm feeling now is breaking my heart

So let me feel your love like Jesus Christ  
Until my heartache heals  
I'll be always by your side as your best friend

I see you're feeling lonely inside  
When nobody's standing by your side  
And what you're feeling now you're trying to hide

So let me help you and wait for you tonight  
As long as you want me to  
I'll do anything for you, I'm your best friend

> This song was dedicated to Miss Lorna Nakamoto, my English teacher who guided me to the love of Jesus Christ. In 1990 she got married with a Japanese engineer and returned to her hometown, Hawaii. Since then I have not heard of her, but I do hope that she is living a happy life with her husband.
